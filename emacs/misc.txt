13:28 < multi_io> does Emacs support linefeeds in replacements texts, e.g. in query-replace-regexp?
13:29 < e1f> yes
13:29 < e1f> c-q c-j
13:30 < multi_io> e1f: thanks :-P
13:31 < multi_io> does it support them in the pattern too, by any chance?


half-automatic indentation/beautification of html etc.

- html-mode etc. must be active

- position cursor at the < that starts the 1st HTML element of the
  area you want to beautify

- C-x (    (start kbd macro)

- Tab

- C-M n    (forward-list)

- return

- C-x )    (stop kbd macro)

- call-last-kbd-macro    (over and over)
