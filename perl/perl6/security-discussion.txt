Okay, we'll try this again... (darned cranky mail clients)

We've two big issues to deal with here--safety and security. While 
related they aren't the same and there are different things that need 
doing. As far as I can see it, we need four things:

1) An oploop that checks branch destinations for validity

2) Opcodes that check their parameters for basic sanity--valid 
register numbers (0-31) and basically correct (ie non-NULL) register 
contents

3) An oploop that checks basic quotas, mainly run time

4) Opcodes that check to see if you can actually do the thing you've requested

#s 1&2 are safety issues. #2, specifically, can be dealt with by the 
opcode preprocessor, generating op bodies that do validity checking. 
#1 needs a bounds-checking runloop, which we mostly have already. I'm 
comfortable getting this done now, and this is what the framework 
that's going in should be able to handle OK.

#s 3&4 deal with security. This... this is a dodgier issue. 
Security's easy to get wrong and hard to get right. (Though quotas 
are straightforward enough. Mostly) And once the framework's in 
place, there's the issue of performance--how do we get good 
performance in the common (insecure) case without sacrificing 
security in the secure case?

At any rate, perl 5's Safe module is a good example of the Wrong Way 
to do security, and as such we're going to take it as a cautionary 
tale rather than a template. For security I want to go with an 
explicit privilege model with privilege checking in parrot's 
internals, rather than counting on op functions to Do The Right 
Thing. That means that IO restrictions are imposed by the IO code, 
not the IO ops, and suchlike stuff. Generally speaking, we're going 
to emulate the VMS quota and privilege system, as it's reasonably 
good as these things go.

If we're going to tackle this, though, we need to pull in some folks 
who're actually competent at it before we do more than handwave about 
the design.

You might wish to consider a modular design here, similar to linux 2.6's 
security modules (LSM)

  http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/papers/module/x47.html

IMO, the advantage would be that parrot apps will have a better idea 
of what security model is appropriate. So if the modular security hooks
can be made cheap enough, the more vexing security/performance tradeoffs 
can be left up to the parrot apps.

No clue how to achieve this though- just a thought from a member of the
peanut gallery.

This is a question without a simple answer, but does Parrot provide an 
infrastructure so that it would be possible to have proof-carrying[1] 
Parrot bytecode?  I'm of course not advocating that we should look into 
proof-carrying code immediately, but I think it's important to realise 
that PCC exists, and that Parrot should be forward-compatible with it, 
if people want to put PCC concepts into Parrot at a later stage.

plenty of other links!

What about it? Safe's one of those modules that's guaranteed to not 
work under Ponie, as are a number of the B modules. That's OK.

Why?

OK, I understand that Ponie will compile Perl 5 source to parrot ops,
and that Safe's interface uses perl ops. However it's a pure
compile-time module -- it hooks into the optree construction routines --
so it may be possible to have an equivalent of it under Ponie.

(not saying that this would be necessarily a good idea, though)

It may be possible, but I'd not count on it. And given how busted it 
is, I think I'd actually prefer it not work.

Anything that twiddles deep in the internals of the interpreter is 
going to fail, and there's not a whole lot we can do about that--our 
internals look very different, and there's a lot that just can't be 
emulated.

Well... maybe.

Parrot apps don't get a whole lot of say here--this is more on the 
order of OS level security. Not that it makes a huge difference, of 
course.

I'm not familiar with the new linux system, and I'm not *going* to 
get familiar enough with it to make any sensible decisions, so I 
think I'd prefer to stick with a system I'm comfortable with and that 
I know's got a solid background. (So at least any problems are a 
matter of implementation rather than design -- those, at least, are 
fixable)

To be specific, I was thinking about embedded parrot apps like mod_perl, 
where it might be nice to enforce a security policy on a per-vhost
(virtual server) basis.  That isn't something all parrot apps would 
benefit from, of course.

In the general sense, no. The presence of eval and the dynamic nature 
of the languages we're looking at pretty much shoots down most of the 
provable bytecode work. Unfortunately.

? I'm not sure if I understand why. (Though I should warn that I did
not read the referenced paper; my concept of PCC comes from reading a
single CMU paper on it a couple of years ago.) My understanding of PCC
is that it freely allows any arbitrarily complex code to be run, as
long as you provide a machine-interpretable (and valid) proof of its
safety along with it. Clearly, eval'ing arbitrary strings cannot be
proved to be safe, so no such proof can be provided (or if it is, it
will discovered to be invalid.) But that just means that you have to
avoid unprovable constructs in your PCC-boxed code.

Eval'ing a specific string *might* be provably safe, which means that
we should have a way for an external (untrusted) compiler to not only
produce bytecode, but also proofs of the safety of that bytecode. We'd
also need, of course, the trusted PCC-equipped bytecode loader to
verify the proof before executing the bytecode. (And we'd need that
anyway to load in and prove the initial bytecode anyway.)

This would largely eliminate one of the main advantages of PCC, namely
that the expensive construction of a proof need not be paid at
runtime, only the relatively cheap proof verification. But if it is
only used for small, easily proven eval's, then it could still make
sense. The fun bit would be allowing the eval'ed code's proof to
reference aspects of the main program's proof. But perhaps the PCC
people have that worked out already?

Let me pause a second to tighten the bungee cord attached to my
desk -- all this handwaving, and I'm starting to lift off a little.

The next step into crazy land could be allowing the proofs to express
detailed properties of strings, such that they could prove that a
particular string could not possibly compile down to unsafe bytecode.
This would only be useful for very restricted languages, of course,
and I'd rather floss my brain with diamond-encrusted piano wire than
attempt to implement such a thing, but I think it still serves as a
proof of concept that Parrot and PCC aren't totally at odds.

Back to reality. I understand that many of Parrot's features would be
difficult to prove, but I'm not sure it's fundamentally any more
difficult than most OO languages. (I assume PCC allows you to punt on
proofs to some degree by inserting explicit checks for unprovable
properties, since then the guarded code can make use of those
properties to prove its own safety.)

It can be safe.  Normally, PCC works by certifying the code during 
compilation, and attaching the machine-checkable certificate with the 
resulting compiled code (be that bytecode, machine code or whatever).  
During runtime, a certificate checker then validates the certificate 
against the provided compiled code, to assure that what the certificate 
says it's true.

If you eval an arbitrary string, the compile/evaluate stages are more 
closely linked: you effectively run the code (and thus check the 
certificate) immediately after compilation.

The main requirement is that Parrot permits some sort of 'hooks', so 
that

     1. during compilation, a certificate of proof can be generated and 
attached with the bytecode, and

     2. before evaluation of the code, a certificate checker has to 
validate the certificate against the code, and also that

     3. Parrot's bytecode format must allow such a certificate to be 
stored with the bytecode.

If you are directly eval'ing an arbitrary string, then yes, you have to 
generate the proof when you compile that string to PBC.  But you can 
also provide a program/subroutine/etc as PBC with a certificate already 
attached.

AFAIK (although I don't know that much :), the Java VM has been proved 
secure to a large extent.

Oh.  In that case, the fact that it's "proof carrying" is just a 
particular case of signed code.  I think that's a solved problem in 
parrot, at least from a design-of-bytecode perspective.  It may have 
become unsolved recently, though.

I thought proof-carrying code contained a proof, not a certificate. 
(The difference is that a proof is verifiably true -- that is, it's 
givens match reality, and each step is valid.  OTOH, a certificate is 
something that we have to use judgment to decide of we want to trust or 
not.)

I think we're done with step 3, but not 1 and 2.

Note that in the common case, there are no eval STRINGs (at runtime), 
and thus all you have to do is prove that you don't eval STRING, which 
should be a much easier proposition.

I suspect most code that wants to be provable will attempt to prove that 
it does not use those features, rather then prove that it uses them safely.

(As pointed out in a deleted bit of the grandparent post, this may 
consist of proving that it has a bit set in the header that says that it 
shouldn't be allowed to eval string, which is easy to prove, since it's 
a verifiable given.)

Do bear in mind that Perl can execute bits of code as it's compiling,
so if a bit of code is untrustworthy, you shouldn't be compiling it
in the first place, unless you've prescanned it to reject C<use>,
C<BEGIN>, and other macro definitions, or (more usefully) have hooks
in the compiler to catch and validate those bits of code before
running them.  Doesn't do you much good to disallow

    eval 'system "rm -rf /"';

at run time if you don't also catch

    BEGIN { system "rm -rf /"; }

at compile time...

(Sorry if I'm just pointing out the obvious.)

That's mostly what Perl 5's Safe is doing. Hence my previous comment.

The major flaw with this approach is that it's probably not going to
prevent
    eval 'while(1){}'
or
    eval '$x = "take this!" x 1_000_000'
or my personal favourite, the always funny 
    eval 'CORE::dump()'
unless you set up a very restrictive set of allowed ops.

(in each case, you abuse system resources: CPU, memory or ability to
send a signal. I don't know how to put restrictions on all of these
in the general case...)

In other words, the compiler must be sure to run immediate bits of code 
with the same restrictions as it would run the real code.

This isn't a parrot issue per say; it's a compiler issue, and I don't 
see how it requires additional mechinisims for parrot, unless possibly 
it's running one pbc (the compiler itself) with one set of 
restrictions/quotas, and another bytecode segment (pbc generated during 
the compile) with another set.

I think we were planning on that anyway (to allow libraries to be more 
trusted then the code that calls them, and callbacks to be less trusted).

Ah, *that* is a different matter altogether.

I'm planning an alternate mechanism for that, though it may be a bit 
much--rather than restricting the dangerous things we make sure all 
the dangerous things can be delegated to the embedder. So file 
manipulation, mass memory allocation/deallocation, and real low-level 
signal handling, for example, all get punted to the embedder, who can 
then do whatever they want.

This means that when we go read some data from a file we call, say, 
Parrot_read, which for the base parrot'll be just read, while for an 
embedded parrot it may call some Apache thunking layer or something 
instead.

Which, if the interpreter's running with quotas, will be caught when 
it either exceeds the allowable memory limits or CPU limits.

Yay, quotas! :)
