&lt;multi_io&gt; hmmm, it seems the package stmt doesn't accept non-constant
           arguments, e.g. "package $pkg". Correct? If so, why?

&lt;bpalmer&gt; multi_io: package affects compilation

&lt;multi_io&gt; bpalmer: I see
&lt;multi_io&gt; thx

&lt;multi_io&gt; my problem is this: I have a subroutine, and in that subroutine, I
           want to eval() a string, with unqualified variable refs in that
           string forced to be in the subroutine's caller's namespace. How
           could I do this then?
&lt;multi_io&gt; the string is non-constant
&lt;multi_io&gt; ie not known until runtime
&lt;woggle&gt; multi_io: If you're doing this for anything but implementing a
          debugger, I strongly suggest you find an alternate way of doing
          this. Specifically, if you're implementing a templating system,
          please look at any of the many existing ones. People do not tie the
          template parameter names to the names of variables in the code for a
          good reason.

&lt;woggle&gt; And if you absolutely insist on doing this, read the docs very
          closely.

&lt;multi_io&gt; woggle: good guess; it's a templating system :). It's more like a
           demonstration of perl's merits as a dynamic language for soem
           die-hard C++ fan... For a serious app, I would use Text::Template
           or something

&lt;woggle&gt; multi_io: I would not consider that you can do this a good thing.
          It's not a good idea to so tightly tie these templates that
          non-programmers are going to edit to the implementation details of
          your code. E.g., it's very easy to accidentally break the templates
          by clarifying a variable name, and it's quite hard, in fact, to edit
          the code without knowing if some variable you are removing or
          whatever will cause problems.
&lt;multi_io&gt; I haven't found a templating system on CPAN which transforms the
           template to a piece of perl code and eval()s that. Wouldn't that be
           a natural design for such a system?
-:- SignOff __Ace__: #perl ()
&lt;woggle&gt; multi_io: Anyways, while perl does support the feature you asked for
          initially, it only supported to let the debugger work.

[MISSING STUFF HERE]

&lt;multi_io&gt; hmm. Haven't looked at the code, but have you seen teh example in
           the manpage containing a foreach loop? They manually append to $OUT
           inside the loop. Very ugly IMHO.

&lt;woggle&gt; It seems what I did kinda worked. (;

-:- SignOff gabber: #perl ("Leaving")
&lt;woggle&gt; Or Chris62vw removed the bot for that other hole he pointed out.

&lt;multi_io&gt; jagerman: no one ever sees or uses the Perl code? So you have your
           own syntax for statements and expressions?
&lt;multi_io&gt; thx for the eval suggestion btw
