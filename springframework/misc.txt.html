- normally, Spring beans are just POJOs, but they may implement
  special framework interfaces e.g. to learn their own name in the
  container, to be notified when they've been inserted into their
  container or when their properties have been set, whenever any bean
  has been inserted into the container (so they can do some processing
  for all the beans in there, e.g. for evaluating annotations -- this
  is how @Autowired is processed in
  org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor)
  etc.

- for example, the latter implements this interface:

  public interface   org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor {
      Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException;

      Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException;

  }

  The callbacks are called for each bean in the container. The
  implementation must return the bean that's really to be inserted. So
  this enables you to automatically e.g. generate some kind of proxy
  here for the real bean.


- org.springframework.beans.factory.FactoryBean&lt;T&gt;

  may apparently be used in the context in place of a bean to provide
  more control over instantiation etc.


- interface org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean {
	/**
	 * Invoked by a BeanFactory after it has set all bean properties supplied
	 * (and satisfied BeanFactoryAware and ApplicationContextAware).
	 * &lt;p&gt;This method allows the bean instance to perform initialization only
	 * possible when all bean properties have been set and to throw an
	 * exception in the event of misconfiguration.
	 * @throws Exception in the event of misconfiguration (such
	 * as failure to set an essential property) or if initialization fails.
	 */
	void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception;

   }

   often used for one-time initialization of another bean
   (e.g. populating a dataSource or repository of some sort with some
   initial data)
