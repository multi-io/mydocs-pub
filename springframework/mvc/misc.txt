- Controller classes marked with @Controller, request handling methods
  with @RequestMapping.

- lots of parameters are accepted for handling methods; see
  http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/mvc.html#mvc-ann-requestmapping-arguments

  - .....

  - request parameters can be automatically captured in "command/form
    objects", which are accepted as handling method parameters. This
    process ("binding") can be customized by writing an @InitBinder
    method that takes a WebDataBinder. Command/form objects may be any
    objects conforming to the JavaBean conventions

- Model / ModelAndView objects for transferring data between
  controller and view

  - Model / ModelAndView object may be explicitly created and
    returned, or it may be declared as a handler method parameter, or
    not be declared/used at all -- in which case one is automatically
    created by the framework. Some attributes are automatically added
    to the model: command/form objects and the results of
    @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods
