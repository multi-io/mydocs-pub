15:47 -!- multi_io [~olaf@port-87-193-172-154.static.qsc.de] has joined #grub

15:49 &lt; multi_io&gt; are the following observations correct:
15:49 &lt; multi_io&gt; the grub legacy documentation sucks, the grub2 documentation doesn't exist.
15:49 &lt; multi_io&gt; ?
15:50 &lt; youpi&gt; the grub2 documentation is incomplete, but it exists
15:51 &lt; multi_io&gt; is there a description of how the different components of grub operate?
15:51 &lt; multi_io&gt; i.e. what's the input data, what does it do
15:51 &lt; multi_io&gt; all the docs I found are just tutorial-style
15:53 &lt; multi_io&gt; e.g. is the code that gets written into the MBR identical in all installations of the same 
                  grub version?
15:53 &lt; multi_io&gt; (and then parameterized by config files in /boot/grub)
15:53 &lt; multi_io&gt; ?
15:56 &lt; multi_io&gt; if it's not identical, then what exactly may be different per-installation?
15:58 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: Well, the mbr loads the embedded part, and it's likely in the embedded bit the 
               largest diff will be seen between systems, unless the partition layout is *exactly* identical
15:58 &lt; multi_io&gt; I mean not just the code, the whole binary image
15:58 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: mbr=boot.img embedded part=core.img
15:59 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: the embedded part is a ~25-30k large binary image which is placed directly after 
               the mbr
16:00 &lt; multi_io&gt; so /boot/grub/boot.img is only used for installing grub, not at startup time
16:00 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: boot.img should be the exact same data which is currently written to your mbr.
16:00 &lt; multi_io&gt; ok
16:01 &lt; multi_io&gt; so /boot/grub/core.img isn't loaded at runtime (i.e. system startup time)?
16:02 &lt; multi_io&gt; instead, it is written behind the mbr at install time?
16:02 &lt; multi_io&gt; and loaded from there at runtime?
16:05 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: In a normal install, the data in that file is also written to the "embedded" part, 
               which is the last bart of the first track (I think) of the HD, and what the mbr (boot.img) 
               does is simply read the mebedded part directly on the first track (data is same as core.img), 
               which loads a more complete environment, which can for example know about partitions, and 
               easily load the grub.cfg module-loader config, and "menu-creator" without the n
16:06 &lt; arand&gt; (At least that's what I've come to understand, I fully agree that the documentation is 
               lacking..)
16:07 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: In answer to last three Qs: Yes
16:09 &lt; multi_io&gt; arand: thanks. your first reply didn't get through completely, it ends at ...and 
                  "menu-creator" without the n
16:10 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: ..."menu-creator" without the need to speify the place it resides just by disk 
               geometry, it can actually specify a partition and filename, which is much more reliable, 
               since it does not reqire the files themselves to be perfectly static physically, on the HD.
16:14 &lt; multi_io&gt; how does the embedded part know the filesystem on which it should access /boot/grub/*
16:14 &lt; multi_io&gt; ?
16:15 &lt; multi_io&gt; is that information written into the binary embedded part by grub-install?
16:15 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: I frankly have no idea, might be...
16:20 -!- phcoder [~phcoder@81.62.187.187] has joined #grub
16:21 &lt; multi_io&gt; alright, thank you, let's assume this is the case then. What files in /boot/grub are 
                  accessed at runtime? Only menu.lst?
16:21 &lt; multi_io&gt; (grub legacy)
16:23 &lt; phcoder&gt; multi_io: topic
16:24 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: (What I've said was all about grub2 by the way), for legacy, I've not looked into 
               that really, there's the thing with stage 1, 1.5 and 2 there...
16:25 &lt; arand&gt; But yea, not grub-legacy support here
16:29 &lt; multi_io&gt; ok, so, in grub2: What files in /boot/grub are accessed at runtime? Only menu.lst?
16:29 &lt; phcoder&gt; multi_io: grub2 has no menu.lst
16:30 &lt; multi_io&gt; ah
16:30 -!- xeon-enouf [~xeon-enou@unaffiliated/xeon-enouf] has quit [Read error: Operation timed out]
16:32 -!- JrCs [~JrCs@mar06-2-88-175-100-234.fbx.proxad.net] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
16:32 &lt; multi_io&gt; so what other files are accessed at runtime (i.e. system startup time) then?
16:33 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: grub.cfg, which in turn (via e.g. "insmod ext2/gfxterm" etc.) loads additional 
               modules if needed.
16:33 &lt; phcoder&gt; "system startup" usually refers to the process which starts after kernel load
16:34 &lt; multi_io&gt; phcoder: I mean the process that loads the kernel
16:34 &lt; phcoder&gt; multi_io: what's your problem and goal?
16:34 &lt; multi_io&gt; arand: where does the shell that interprets that file come from? Is it embedded in the 
                  embedded part? (core.img)
16:35 &lt; multi_io&gt; phcoder: I want to know how grub operates. Since there's no documentation to speak of 
                  (only some tutorial-style fragments), I came here
16:35 &lt; phcoder&gt; it's in normal.mod and sh.mod
16:36 &lt; multi_io&gt; so it acceeses thos files too?
16:36 &lt; phcoder&gt; *.mod are used in grub
16:37 &lt; multi_io&gt; alright
16:38 &lt; multi_io&gt; phcoder: is the binary image that gets written into the MBR and the region after it 
                  (embedded part, outside any filesystem) binary identical across all grub installation with 
                  the same grub version on the same architecture?
16:39 &lt; multi_io&gt; if not, what parametrization of it happens at install time
16:39 &lt; multi_io&gt; ?
16:39 &lt; phcoder&gt; no. core.img contains compressed kernel.img + disk module + partition module + FS module
16:41 &lt; multi_io&gt; aren't those parts all constant over all installations per-architecture?
16:42 &lt; multi_io&gt; e.g. kernel.img is part of my grub debian package here
16:42 &lt; phcoder&gt; No. You can install with e.g. ata+XFS+GPT or with biosdisk+fat+msdos.
16:44 &lt; multi_io&gt; ok
16:46 &lt; multi_io&gt; so those modules will all be merged into the binary part that gets written after the mbr, 
                  i.e. outside any filesystem?
16:47 &lt; multi_io&gt; (the "embedded part" as it's apparently named)
16:48 &lt; multi_io&gt; or does that embedded part only contain a list of module names, which are then accessed at 
                  runtime in /boot/grub in the filesystem?
16:50 &lt; phcoder&gt; first one
16:50 &lt; phcoder&gt; you need those modules to find other modules
16:51 &lt; phcoder&gt; and there are few config variables in second block of core.img
16:53 &lt; multi_io&gt; can you give an example of a modules that "finds" another module?
16:53 &lt; phcoder&gt; you need embeded modules to access fs, modules don't "search for another modules" (except 
                 some autoloading hooks in normal.mod)
16:55 &lt; multi_io&gt; so by "you need those modules to find other modules" you meant you need those modules to 
                  do things like accessing the filesystem?
16:56 &lt; phcoder&gt; yes
16:57 -!- jerone-mobile [~jerone@adsl-71-145-129-122.dsl.austtx.sbcglobal.net] has joined #grub
16:57 &lt; multi_io&gt; alright, thanks. Now, what are those "few config variables in second block of core.img"?
16:57 &lt; multi_io&gt; maybe there's documentation on them?
16:58 &lt; phcoder&gt; they are in source
16:58 &lt; phcoder&gt; in startup.S
16:59 &lt; multi_io&gt; i.e. not modifiable by grub users?
17:01 &lt; phcoder&gt; they are patched in by grub-mkimage. Only prefix is to be modifeid by users
17:01 &lt; phcoder&gt; normally you shoul use only grub-install which does the rest
17:04 &lt; multi_io&gt; VARIABLE(grub_prefix) /* to be filled by grub-mkimage */
17:06 &lt; multi_io&gt; so gets written into that?
17:07 &lt; multi_io&gt; the identification of the drive on which the /boot filesystem is to be accessed?
17:08 &lt; multi_io&gt; s/drive/partition/ or whatever
17:08 &lt; multi_io&gt; ah, only the directory name
17:09 &lt; multi_io&gt; right?
17:12 &lt; phcoder&gt; multi_io: generally yes
17:14 &lt; multi_io&gt; phcoder: how does the embedded part know the filesystem on which it should access 
                  /boot/grub/* then?
17:14 &lt; multi_io&gt; is that information also patched into it?
17:15 &lt; phcoder&gt; multi_io: yes
17:18 &lt; multi_io&gt; phcoder: ...and that information corresponds to the &lt;install_device&gt; in  grub-install 
                  &lt;install_device&gt; I assume?
17:19 &lt; phcoder&gt; multi_io: no, it corresponds to /boot driver
17:20 &lt; multi_io&gt; (fear of using under-documented software that wants to write into you hard dist MBR is 
                  completely rational)
17:21 &lt; phcoder&gt; multi_io: rather than blaming lack of documentation you could, you know, write it
17:25 &lt; multi_io&gt; phcoder: seems like you're knowledgeable enough to write it youself much better
17:25 &lt; multi_io&gt; but maybe I'll post this conversation online. It's a better documentation than any I've 
                  found.
17:25 &lt; multi_io&gt; (thanks for that btw)
17:25 &lt; phcoder&gt; multi_io: I have no time for it.
17:31 &lt; multi_io&gt; phcoder: why are so many *.mod files written into /boot/grub if they're not used at 
                  runtime?
17:32 &lt; multi_io&gt; (you said that the modules are embedded into the embedded part at install time)
17:33 &lt; phcoder&gt; multi_io: only modules needed to access /boot.
17:33 &lt; phcoder&gt; other modules are loaded as-needed
17:33 &lt; phcoder&gt; only small portion of modules are actually loaded on any given configuration
17:38 &lt; multi_io&gt; ok, thanks. Now, again, how does the embedded part (or more specifically, the "/boot 
                  driver" part of it, as you named it) know the filesystem on which to access /boot/grub?
17:39 &lt; phcoder&gt; it's a field in second sector of core.img
17:40 &lt; multi_io&gt; ok. And it gets patched into that by who?
17:40 &lt; multi_io&gt; and from what user-supplied information?
17:42 &lt; phcoder&gt; by grub-setup. It's autodetected
17:43 -!- lyhana8 [~quassel@122-117-35-27.HINET-IP.hinet.net] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
17:43 &lt; phcoder&gt; g2g
17:44 &lt; phcoder&gt; or rather g2r
17:44 -!- phcoder [~phcoder@81.62.187.187] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
17:44 &lt; multi_io&gt; phcoder: you mean it's autodetected at runtime from something like "(hd0,1)"?
17:45 &lt; multi_io&gt; (hope he reads that one day)
17:48 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: Hmm, when you run grub-install or grub-setup you need to specify where the grub 
               files (i.e. where /boot/grub is/)are located/installed, so I assume it's figured out from 
               that.
17:49 -!- phcoder [~phcoder@81.62.187.187] has joined #grub
17:49 &lt; multi_io&gt; arand: yeah, that's what I thought
17:49 &lt; multi_io&gt; hah, you're back phcoder 
17:49 &lt; phcoder&gt; R stands for Reboot
17:50 &lt; multi_io&gt; I see
17:50 -!- Karwan [zyckde@gateway/shell/blinkenshell.org/x-xpzsggsymsbbhxpg] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 
          seconds]
17:51 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: For example if I run grub-probe /boot/grub I get response "ext2", which I guess 
               means I could use the ext2 module to access it. So it's placed in core.img in that case?
17:51 &lt; multi_io&gt; phcoder: you said the information on filesystem the /boot/grub is gets patched into a 
                  field in the 2nd sector of core.img by grub-setup and is then "autodetected".
17:52 &lt; multi_io&gt; phcoder: you mean it's autodetected at runtime from something like "(hd0,1)"?
17:52 &lt; phcoder&gt; no, autodetected by grub-setup and patched in.
17:52 &lt; multi_io&gt; aha
17:53 &lt; multi_io&gt; so that's a problem if the maching you're running grub-install on isn't the same as the 
                  machine you're going to boot on?
17:53 &lt; multi_io&gt; e.g. hard disk for embedded machine, mounted via USB on laptop for installation
17:53 &lt; phcoder&gt; it's not a problem. Partition stays the same. And disk is detected from BIOS
17:54 &lt; multi_io&gt; detected from BIOS on the laptop?
17:54 &lt; multi_io&gt; (i.e. the machine you're running grub-install on)
17:54 &lt; phcoder&gt; No. Detected on runtime
17:55 &lt; multi_io&gt; that's what I meant above with 'autodetected at runtime from something like "(hd0,1)"'
17:55 &lt; phcoder&gt; No
17:56 &lt; phcoder&gt; Detected from %dl and a variable in 2nd sector.
17:56 &lt; multi_io&gt; so grub-install doesn't autodetect anything, it just writes "(hd0,1)" into that field in 
                  some abstract, machine/arch-independent format?
17:56 &lt; multi_io&gt; (or grub-setup)
17:56 &lt; phcoder&gt; It detects which partition /boot is on.
17:57 &lt; phcoder&gt; There is much of autodetection under the hood
17:57 &lt; phcoder&gt; you don't see it and it's exactly the goal
17:59 &lt; multi_io&gt; can it be overridden?
17:59 &lt; phcoder&gt; What do you want to do?
18:00 &lt; multi_io&gt; i.e. can I tell grub-install "assume that what's now /dev/sda is going to be (hd0,1) at 
                  runtime, so write that into the field"?
18:00 &lt; multi_io&gt; I probably didn't really understand what you said in your last three lines
18:01 &lt; phcoder&gt; Most of autodetections aren't overridable since it brings nothing to be able to override it 
                 except giving user the ability to destroy their data by incorrect guess.
18:01 &lt; phcoder&gt; grub has no problem with drives changing name
18:01 &lt; phcoder&gt; it uses %dl
18:04 &lt; multi_io&gt; that's passed into it at runtime by the bios?
18:04 &lt; phcoder&gt; yes
18:06 &lt; multi_io&gt; so grub will at runtime always use a filesystem on the same drive that it was loaded from?
18:07 &lt; phcoder&gt; No, we support cross-disks installs too. In that case we use UUIDs.
18:08 &lt; multi_io&gt; ..so no %dl in that case.
18:13 &lt; multi_io&gt; so in that case the uuid would be read by grub-install, patched into core.img, and then 
                  used from there at runtime to locate the disk in the system?
18:30 &lt; multi_io&gt; ...and the uuid grub-install writes out would be the one of the disk the --root-directory 
                  is located on (which is what grub-install "auto-detects")?

[...]

20:24 &lt; multi_io&gt; somebody should prolly separate grub_install from the whole autodetection machinery, and 
                  just have the former read a config file that the latter generates.
20:25 &lt; multi_io&gt; (unless I misunderstand what this thing really does)
20:26 &lt; phcoder&gt; clausen: because you can't know X in (hdX,1) for sure
20:26 &lt; clausen&gt; yeah, I get that
20:26 &lt; clausen&gt; that you don't know it for sure
20:26 &lt; clausen&gt; but I don't understand why that function was deprecated
20:26 &lt; phcoder&gt; multi_io: it's pointless

[...]

21:10 &lt; multi_io&gt; so, to summarize, /usr/sbin/grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/newtick /dev/sda   ran 
                  through,
21:10 &lt; multi_io&gt; with /mnt/newtick/boot/grub/device.map containing (hd1)/dev/sda.
21:10 &lt; multi_io&gt; ..which is correct right now (install time), but won't be at runtime.
21:11 &lt; multi_io&gt; (at which time what is now /dev/sda will be hd0)
21:11 &lt; multi_io&gt; is this installation going to work?
21:12 &lt; multi_io&gt; or do I have to modify /mnt/newtick/boot/grub/device.map to contain (hd0) /dev/sda ?

21:35 &lt; multi_io&gt; must device.map contain the configuration as it is at grub-install time or at system 
                  startup time?
21:36 &lt; arand&gt; multi_io: I have no idea, if you use --recheck it should create one, which presumably should 
               be correct..
21:36 &lt; phcoder_&gt; multi_io: doesn't matter. I already told you that.
21:38 &lt; multi_io&gt; if it doesn't matter, why does the file exist?
21:38 &lt; multi_io&gt; (sorry, that was probably a devil's advocate question)
21:39 &lt; phcoder_&gt; multi_io: we're in progress of removing it
21:39 &lt; multi_io&gt; arand: that would give me the configuration as it is at grub-install time I guess
21:40 &lt; multi_io&gt; phcoder_: really?
21:40 &lt; multi_io&gt; so both variants will work in my case?
21:40 &lt; phcoder_&gt; yes
21:41 &lt; multi_io&gt; so it would use that information only as a fallback at runtime (i.e. normally it won't use 
                  it at all)?
21:41 &lt; phcoder_&gt; yes
21:41 &lt; multi_io&gt; I see. Thanks.


----

read at runtime (= system startup time):

- /boot/grub/grub.cfg

  - shell script-like program source code (interpreted at runtime by
    grub). contains menu entry definitions. Example:

menuentry 'Debian GNU/Linux, with Linux 2.6.24' --class debian --class gnu-linux
 --class gnu --class os {
        insmod msdos
        insmod ext2
        set root='(/dev/hdb,1)'
        search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set 9d74ffed-ebbc-463f-8935-177d5ad177d6
        echo    'Loading Linux 2.6.24 ...'
        linux   /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.24 root=/dev/hdb1 ro console=ttyS0,19200n8 acp
i=off 
}

    the "insmod" module names refer to grub modules,
    e.g. /boot/grub/ext2.mod for reading ext2 filesystems. "insmod"
    loads such modules at runtime, and they may then be used to
    perform specific tasks. They have nothing to do with Linux kernel
    modules.


- /boot/grub/grub.cfg is generated at setup time from
  /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d/* by update-grub
