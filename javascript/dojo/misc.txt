- base library dojo, widget library dijit

- unified event processing: wiring up using dojo.connect, can connect
  DOM events as well as dijit widget events

- widget creation:

  - widgets live in a DOM node (property .domNode)

  - can be created fuly programmatically (no reference in HTML), but
    most of the times there will be a HTML element containing basic
    attributes of the widget, which will be parsed by dojo to create
    the widget at runtime. The required "dojoType" special attribute
    specifies the dijit type name. Example:

    <button id="showDlgBtn" dojoType="dijit.form.Button">Click Me!</button>

    In the JS code, you'd dojo.require("dijit.form.Button"), at which
    time the Button widget's code is loaded. The HTML will be parsed,
    the button element found, and the corresponding widget object
    created. This parsing is done automatically if you have a
    djConfig="parseOnLoad: true" attribute of the body tag, or it can
    be initialized programmatically using dojo.parser.parse().
