03:31 &lt; multi_io&gt; what I have is essentially three select boxes select1, select2, select3, where the contents of each 
                  select depends on what is selected in the previous select
03:31 &lt; multi_io&gt; ...and the contents of each select I fetch via async xhr, with the value of the previous select as 
                  a request parameter
03:32 &lt; kgf&gt; multi_io: dojo.when doesn't always return a promise. it returns what it receives, if that's a promise that's 
             what it returns. iinm.
03:32 &lt; kgf&gt; but once you HAVE a promise, .then can chain either
03:33 &lt; multi_io&gt; so in the change handler of select1 I essentially have fillSelect2().then(fillSelect3)
03:34 &lt; kgf&gt; wouldn't you rather the user actually /choose/ something from select 2 first?
03:34 &lt; snover&gt; use dojo.when if what is being returned is a promise *or* a value
03:35 &lt; snover&gt; only use .then if you know that what is returned is always a promise
03:36 &lt; multi_io&gt; where each fillSelectX essentially does return 
                  dojo.xhrGet({url:"getSelectXContents?q="+(selectX-1).getValue()}).then(function(newEntries) {selectX.set("options", 
                  newEntries)});
03:37 &lt; multi_io&gt; kgf: this was just the change handler for select1. If the user selects something in that, both 
                  select2 and select3 have to be switched to new default values
03:38 &lt; kgf&gt; multi_io: ah
03:38 &lt; kgf&gt; multi_io: but it sounds like both involve xhrGet and thus promises?
03:38 &lt; multi_io&gt; kgf: right
03:40 &lt; kgf&gt; so you can use .then the whole way
03:40 &lt; multi_io&gt; now, what I said above applies. Sometimes e.g. fillSelect2 sees that it doesn't actually need to do 
                  the xhr call, it can just set select2's contents synchronously and return.
03:40 &lt; kgf&gt; oh
03:40 &lt; multi_io&gt; what I do right now in that situation is:
03:41 &lt; multi_io&gt; select2.set("options", newContents); var result = new dojo.Deferred(); result.callback(); return 
                  result;
03:41 &lt; kgf&gt; yeah that's the heavyweight approach I suppose lol
03:41 &lt; multi_io&gt; so I can retain that nice chaining of then calls in the caller
03:42 &lt; kgf&gt; granted .then chaining is so much nicer than the alternative... dojo.when is susceptible to the same 
             nasty nesting that .then tends to avoid.
03:44 &lt; multi_io&gt; kgf: so you'd say dojo.when isn't necessarily better in my situation.
04:16 &lt; kgf&gt; multi_io: you've only got 2 things going on. it's not really going to be painful there
04:16 &lt; kgf&gt; but also if you've ever got a sequence of events where the first thing is a guaranteed to be a promise, iiuc
             dojo.when is unnecessary, since .then chains both deferreds and fully-synchronous calls.

03:10 &lt; snover&gt; dojo.when(xhrGet(…), function (val) { dojo.when(somethingElseThatReturnsAPromiseOrValue, function 
                (val2) { more stuff… }) })
03:11 &lt; multi_io&gt; snover: right, that's how I thought it'd work, but it looks a lot uglier than chaining then() calls.

22:47 &lt; multi_io&gt; isn't it unfortunate that dojo.when does not return a promise?
22:47 &lt; kgf&gt; multi_io: hehehe
22:48 &lt; kgf&gt; I think so too
22:48 &lt; kgf&gt; the interesting thing is if you look at kriskowal's q.js (implementation of Promises/B), when DOES return a promise
22:48 &lt; kgf&gt; and it has an asap method that does what dojo.when does
22:48 &lt; kgf&gt; BUT I will admit that dojo.when should be more lightweight
22:48 &lt; kgf&gt; er, meaning, in its present form, it is more lightweight than promises/B's version
22:50 &lt; multi_io&gt; kgf: so it's not just sloppiness of dojo guys, but they did it to be more lightweight?
22:51 &lt; kgf&gt; multi_io: I reckon it was intentional
22:51 &lt; kgf&gt; I'm not sure whether it's actually part of the Promises specs or not
22:52 &lt; kgf&gt; I see when and asap documented in Promises/B but when isn't mentioned in Promises/A
22:54 &lt; multi_io&gt; on http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/B it says that when returns a promise
22:56 &lt; kgf&gt; multi_io: that's what I'm saying
22:56 &lt; kgf&gt; dojo follows Promises/A
22:56 &lt; kgf&gt; but when doesn't appear to be within the spec in that case
22:56 -!- setsunafseisei [~chatzilla@ip68-100-149-92.dc.dc.cox.net] has joined #dojo
22:56 &lt; kgf&gt; personally I've wanted to take a closer look at q.js, it seems interesting to me and well thought out
22:56 &lt; kgf&gt; but in the case of when I can see pros/cons either way
22:57 &lt; kgf&gt; and naturally it's possible to wrap dojo.when to always use a promise if you wanted
