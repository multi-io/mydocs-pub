A data store instance (at least for grid widgets) contains a sequence
of items, where an item is a sequence of name->value (String->Object)
mappings. Generally (for grids at least) all items should probably
have the same attribute names.

When the store is displayed in a grid, items correspond to rows, and
attributes correspond to columns (with the attribute names displayed
in the column titles).

There are API definitions (specified as classes with empty methods)
for reading and writing stores: dojo.data.api.Read,
dojo.data.api.Write.

The API allows items to be represented by any JS object (i.e. not just
maps or anything like that) -- explicit API functions are defined for
getting the values of an item etc.

The API defines a boolean "isLoaded" state for items, plus a
loadItem() method etc. Probably intented for things like local
caching; the grid will presumably display hourglasses etc. for
non-loaded items.

The API defines an "error" state on items.

The API defines a "label" (string) for items.


Numerous default implementations for stores are provided, using for
their backends CSV lists, AJAX calls returning JSON data, and others.
