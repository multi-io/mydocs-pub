big, messy

lots of global variables

"The nnfolder directory" nnfolder-directory (used by
e.g. nnfolder-generate-active-file) -- huh? Should be per server.

e.g.
(let ((nnfolder-directory "~/Mail/archive/archive"))
  (nnfolder-generate-active-file))

creates the active file for the "first" nnfolder server (don't know
the exact criteria, but it's always the same server, no matter what
the value of nnfolder-directory is)
