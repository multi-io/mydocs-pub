23:06 &lt; multi_io&gt; is it possible to iterate over all resources inside a given package/"directory" in a given classloader?
23:06 &lt; Epesh&gt; multi_io: yes, but not trivially
23:07 &lt; multi_io&gt; Epesh: how?
23:07 &lt; Epesh&gt; multi_io: write your own classloader
23:08 &lt; multi_io&gt; that a nonsolution I'm afraid :)
23:08 &lt; multi_io&gt; that's
23:08 &lt; ernimril&gt; multi_io: you can not do it for any classloader, there may be a classloader that creates random resources 
                  upon request...
23:09 &lt; ernimril&gt; multi_io: but you can look at the classpath and find out which jar/zip files is in that and then check 
                  them all manually...
23:09 &lt; multi_io&gt; well, it would be okay to define it as an "optional operation", much like similar approaches in the 
                  collections library
23:09 &lt; ernimril&gt; multi_io: but that will not handle classes/resources that are loaded from the net...
23:10 &lt; slava&gt; multi_io, why don't you store the list of resources in another resource with a known name?
23:10 &lt; multi_io&gt; Blackwell: access resources in the system CL using file I/O APIs. Type of system CL is not known until 
                  runtime
23:10 &lt; Epesh&gt; multi_io: you don't need to know the type
23:11 &lt; Blackwell&gt; multi_io: i don't understand the description.
23:11 &lt; Epesh&gt; anyway, I'm off for home - have a good weekend, everyone
23:12 &lt; multi_io&gt; Blackwell: I'm trying to open files in the system classloader using file I/O (e.g. FileInputStream)
23:12 &lt; multi_io&gt; so I want to copy them to a tempdir first
23:12 &lt; slava&gt; multi_io, use resource streams
23:12 &lt; slava&gt; wtf
23:12 &lt; slava&gt; you've got it all wrong
23:12 &lt; multi_io&gt; I cannot change the code that uses the file APIs
23:12 &lt; multi_io&gt; it's not mine
23:12 &lt; slava&gt; then you're fucked i guess
23:13 &lt; Blackwell&gt; multi_io: i don't understand "to open files in the system classloader"
23:15 &lt; multi_io&gt; the system CL (like any CL) defines a hierarchy of named piles of bytes, much like a filesystem, right?
23:15 &lt; Blackwell&gt; what does "CL" mean?
23:15 &lt; multi_io&gt; I want to access that using Java file APIs...
23:16 &lt; multi_io&gt; classloader
23:16 &lt; Blackwell&gt; aha
23:16 &lt; multi_io&gt; :)
23:16 &lt; Blackwell&gt; you want to access .class files?
23:16 &lt; multi_io&gt; no, text files
23:16 &lt; multi_io&gt; .jsp, .txt etc
23:18 &lt; multi_io&gt; I know that the files are not loaded from the net
23:19 &lt; multi_io&gt; in fact, I think I can assume that they come from either the filesystem or a Jar file
23:19 &lt; Blackwell&gt; multi_io: i can't say am able to follow much of what you say. maybe i am too tired.
23:20 &lt; multi_io&gt; maybe my English sucks :)
23:20 &lt; multi_io&gt; too much
23:21 &lt; multi_io&gt; I'm writing unit tests
23:21 &lt; ernimril&gt; multi_io: get the classpath then: for each file in the classpath, try to open it as a jar-file, if that 
                  open succeds iterator over all entries and check if it is a wanted resource
23:21 &lt; ernimril&gt; multi_io: what is hard about that?
23:21 &lt; multi_io&gt; they need some resources from text files
23:22 &lt; multi_io&gt; and they use that special unmidifiable API mentioned above for accessing them
23:22 &lt; ernimril&gt; they?
23:22 &lt; ernimril&gt; who are they?
23:22 &lt; multi_io&gt; the unit tests
23:23 &lt; ernimril&gt; what special api?
23:23 &lt; multi_io&gt; the API that uses Java's File APIs (FileInputStream etc.) to access those files
23:23 &lt; multi_io&gt; I cannot modify it
23:24 &lt; multi_io&gt; I can only tell it the filesystem path where the files reside
23:24 &lt; ernimril&gt; why do you need to modify a resource? you read resources for images and/or texts....
23:24 &lt; multi_io&gt; so I thought I'd copy the whole hierarchy from the classloader to a tempdir
23:25 &lt; multi_io&gt; I cannot modify the API (that uses Java's File APIs (FileInputStream etc.) to access those files)
23:25 &lt; multi_io&gt; :)
23:26 &lt; ernimril&gt; multi_io: you are not making sense. Try to think about what you need, then write a good explanation about 
                  the problem
23:29 &lt; multi_io&gt; "you're not making sense" is a bit unspecific :)
23:30 &lt; multi_io&gt; to be a bit more specific, the "unmodifiable API" is a templating engine. Much like a JSP container.
23:30 &lt; multi_io&gt; The templates are text files in the filesystem
23:31 &lt; multi_io&gt; I tell the templatign engine the location of the templates (as a filesystem path+name), and it expands them
23:32 &lt; multi_io&gt; I'm writing unit tests for that templating engine
23:32 &lt; multi_io&gt; so I have some test templates
23:33 &lt; multi_io&gt; On the system where the tests are finally run, I can only use the System Classloader to access any kind of 
                  resources (e.g. text files)
23:33  * Blackwell looks left, right
23:33 &lt; multi_io&gt; I cannot change that
23:34 &lt; multi_io&gt; So I have to put the test templates in the System Classloader, and at runtime, copy them to a tempdir and 
                  point the templating engine to that
23:35 &lt; multi_io&gt; If that wasn't specific enough, I'm out of luck
23:36 &lt; Blackwell&gt; multi_io: maybe this is related, i don't know: http://javafaq.mine.nu/lookup?145
23:37 &lt; ernimril&gt; multi_io: ok, the system classloader uses the classpath, so my question about reading that....  is still 
                  valid.
23:37 &lt; Blackwell&gt; multi_io: i don't understand your description. why you are doing all these things, etc. pp. you may be 
                   assuming too much knowledge
23:37 &lt; Blackwell&gt; +by the readers in here
23:41 &lt; multi_io&gt; ernimril: what question about reading what?
23:41 &lt; multi_io&gt; I dont't want to modify the resources, only read them
23:42 &lt; ernimril&gt; multi_io: get the classpath then: for each file in the classpath, try to open it as a jar-file, if that 
                  open succeds iterator over all entries and check if it is a wanted resource
23:42 &lt; multi_io&gt; This should have become clear by now :)
23:43 &lt; multi_io&gt; ernimril: OK, I think that'll do. Thanks.
