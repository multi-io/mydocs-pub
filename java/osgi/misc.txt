[15:14] <multi_io> I have two projects A and B, where A depends on (uses code from) B. I want to use A and B in an RCP UI application and in a server application. The UI application is OSGI-based, the server application is not.
[15:15] <multi_io> so I would configure A and B as RCP plugin projects in Eclipse (for the UI app), and as normal projects with .classpath dependecy configuration (for the server app)
[15:16] <multi_io> is that a good idea?
[15:16] <rcjsuen> I would just make all the Java projects OSGi bundles.
[15:16] <rcjsuen> and let PDE manage the classpath that way through MANIFEST.MF
[15:17] <rcjsuen> or use Neil's bndtools if you don't like pde
[15:17] <multi_io> rcjsuen: but the server app isn't an RCP app (it's a normal Eclipse project that depends on A and B)...
[15:18] <rcjsuen> That statement doesn't change how I feel. :)
[15:19] <mart> I use that approach. We have libraries that are shared by sonar and eclipse plugins, and the libraries are all in Eclipse as PDE projects
[15:21] <mart> Actually, we're using maven, so it's some m2e connector that adds the PDE classpath container.
[15:22] <paulweb515> multi_io: if they're valid OSGi bundles then they're valid java jars (unless they depend on proper modularization in some way)
[15:22] <paulweb515> multi_io: if they are plugins that contribute to the UI, however, I'm not sure how you could run them outside of the workbench
[15:24] <multi_io> paulweb515: they don't contain UI stuff
[15:25] <paulweb515> multi_io: ok, that's one less thing to worry about
[15:26] <rcjsuen> Being an OSGi bundle doesn't imply that jar is a UI library. :o
[15:27] <paulweb515> rcjsuen: I was just clarifying ... OSGi bundles are just jars, but a plugin that depends on the workbench would never run outside of OSGi :-)
[15:30] <multi_io> paulweb515: the thing is, I don't want to include them as JARs in the server app's Properties/JavaBuildPath/Libraries because doing so would increase the turnaround time when changing stuff in A/B.
[15:30] <multi_io> I want to include A and B in the server app's JavaBuildPath/Projects.
[15:33] <multi_io> ...but it seems I'm getting "Build path contains duplicate entry" when I include B in A's dependecies both as a MANIFEST.MF RequireBundle and as a JavaBuildPath dependency.
[15:34] <paulweb515> multi_io: for A and B, use the MANIFEST.MF and then use PDE Tools>Update Classpath
[15:34] <paulweb515> multi_io: that'll make sure they compile
[15:36] <paulweb515> multi_io: when working on the server you can just add the dependency to the java classpath from server java project to project A or project B
[15:45] <multi_io> paulweb515: looks like PDE Tools>Update Classpath just removes all the JavaBuildPath dependencies...
[15:47] <paulweb515> multi_io: why would that matter to you?
[15:51] <multi_io> paulweb515: hm, the dependency resolution must work when I run the whole thing in a non-OSGI app (i.e. the server app)...
[15:51] <multi_io> would it honor the MANIFEST.MF dependency in that case?
[15:52] <paulweb515> multi_io: within eclipse, it should be fine
[15:52] <paulweb515> the PDE classpath container adds the correct jars to the classpath, even when it's considered a plain java app
[15:52] <multi_io> ok...
[15:57] <paulweb515> I created a java project, and added org.ecilpse.jface project and o.e.swt.arch.jar to its classpath, and I was able to launch a java JFace/SWT app
[15:57] <paulweb515> treating them like java projects works fine
[16:00] <paulweb515> multi_io: i.e. using Update Classpath on the bundles A and B is the right thing to do.  When you create your server java project, you'll have to put whatever deps on it that you require to get it to compile and launch
[16:01] <multi_io> paulweb515: so I'll configure the server app, A and B as plugin projects, declare the dependencies in the MANIFEST.MF only (not in .classpath), and then run the server app as a non-OSGI java app?
[16:03] <paulweb515> multi_io: yes, and you'll add the projects A/B to the server build path
[16:04] <paulweb515> fuho: Plug-in Development Environment.  It's useful for finding out what exactly implements view or editors in eclipse (for plugin developers)
[16:06] <multi_io> paulweb515: by "server build path" you mean project properties / Java Build Path / Projects ?
[16:21] <multi_io> paulweb515, rcjsuen: I've done some tests, and it looks like I can indeed configure a project (server app) as a plugin project and declare its dependencies as OSGI plugin dependencies (MANIFEST.MF/RequireBundle) only, and then...
[16:22] <multi_io> ... run the app as a standard non-OSGI app, and it still picks up the dependencies from the manifest.mf and runs.
[16:22] <multi_io> so I guess this is the preferred way to do this.
[17:14] <paulweb515> multi_io: that's not really what I meant, but yes that will work as well
[17:21] <multi_io> paulweb515: you meant to configure the server app as a standard java project and add the dependencies to A and B (which are plugin projects) to the server app's project properties / Java Build Path / Projects ?
[17:21] <paulweb515> multi_io: yes.  Although I reguarly do what you did, create a plugin project that depens on o.e.ui so that I can write java JFace/SWT apps :-)
[17:22] <paulweb515> multi_io: having the server app just a standard java project will help you manage your java classpath for the server, so you don't get too many surprises

Looks like the "Build path contains duplicate entry" error does NOT
occur when the project isn't an RCP project (i.e. it doesn't have a
"PluginNature" entry in its .project). So with such a project, you can
have the same dependencies in .classpath and MANIFEST.MF.  Even then
it will still pick up MANIFEST.MF dependencies, at least when run in
an OSGI app (not sure about when run as a Java app).

[17:28] <multi_io> paulweb515: I noticed that, apparently, the "Build path contains duplicate entry" in A does NOT occur if I do not configure A as an OSGI project in Eclipse, and then declare the dependency on B in both MANIFEST.MF and .classpath.
[17:29] <multi_io> apparently A will still be run as an OSGI plugin when the client app (RCP app with plugin dependency on A) is run.
[17:30] <multi_io> does that surprise you? :-P
[17:34] <rcjsuen> if you're using MANIFEST.MF, don't use .classpath
[17:36] <nitind> Rather, don't modify it yourself.
[17:36] <multi_io> my ultimate goal is to autogenerate both with gradle :P
