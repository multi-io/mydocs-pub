05:18 &lt; multi_io&gt; I have another feature request: make enums extendable :-P
05:18 &lt; ojacobson&gt; multi_io: er.  no.  ew.  don't do that.
05:19 &lt; r0bby&gt; multi_io: People are going to think you're on crack.
05:19 &lt; multi_io&gt; why?
05:19 &lt; Woflborg&gt; multi_io: since you do not bow down and worship the javaness 
                  as it is!
05:19 &lt; Woflborg&gt; multi_io: gods by definition are perfect.
05:19 &lt; ojacobson&gt; switch (someEnum) that satisfies all possible values of 
                   someEnum's direct class may not satisfy all (or even most) 
                   values of someEnum's class's descendants
05:19 &lt; ojacobson&gt; that's an important part of "being an enumeration"
05:21 &lt; ojacobson&gt; If I wanted a reference type that could have values I don't 
                   know about I wouldn't have created an enumeration.
05:21 &lt; multi_io&gt; you have an EventBase class with a method EventBase.Kind 
                  getKind() where EventBase.King is an enum { foo, bar }, and 
                  then sub-event classes that want to define additional kinds 
                  of events...
05:21 &lt; multi_io&gt; ojacobson: ok, point taken
05:22 &lt; ojacobson&gt; (I might have used the old "typesafe enum" pattern with a 
                   protected c'tor and heavy documentation.)
05:22 &lt; ojacobson&gt; (Or I might just have used a class or interface. :)
05:22 &lt; multi_io&gt; ojacobson: I did just that
05:22 &lt; multi_io&gt; there's no other way, basically
05:29 &lt; ojacobson&gt; (Personally I think enum itself is a little bit of a wart, 
                   but then, I don't use it much.  I think I've written three 
                   of them.)
