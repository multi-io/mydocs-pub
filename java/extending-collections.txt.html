05:03 &lt; multi_io&gt; hmm, a class with only private constructors is not only not 
                  instantiatable, it's also not extendable, right?
05:03 &lt; ojacobson&gt; multi_io: true
05:04 &lt; ojacobson&gt; Not quite non-instantiable, methods (even static ones) in 
                   the same class can create them.
05:04 &lt; ojacobson&gt; But close enough for gov't work.
05:04 &lt; multi_io&gt; I wanted to "add" my own utility methods to 
                  java.util.Collections by deriving myproject.Collections from 
                  it and adding the methods to that
05:05 &lt; multi_io&gt; it feels stupid to write a completely disjoint class 
                  MyCollections
05:05 &lt; ojacobson&gt; multi_io: what would you gain by inheriting from Collections?
05:06 &lt; multi_io&gt; ...and then always having to remember whether a given method 
                  is defined in java.util.Collections or myproject.MyCollections
05:06 &lt; ojacobson&gt; Anyways, Collections is not (afaik) final
05:06 &lt; multi_io&gt; ojacobson: as I say, I just want to "add" some methods to it 
                  that were "forgotten"
05:06 &lt; ojacobson&gt; You can derive from it, you just can't instantiate your 
                   derived class.
05:07 &lt; ojacobson&gt; ...wait, I might be lying furiously.
05:07 &lt; multi_io&gt; I can'T.
05:07 &lt; multi_io&gt; compiler complains b/c the construictor can't call super()
05:07 &lt; ojacobson&gt; right, because the default constructor would have to invoke 
                   the parent class's () constructor, even if you provide one.
05:08 &lt; multi_io&gt; well, this sucks
05:09 &lt; ojacobson&gt; In that you might have to remember what methods you 
                   implemented, yes
05:09 &lt; ojacobson&gt; I have to admit, I'm not seeing the huge burden
05:09 &lt; r0bby&gt; nice.
05:10 &lt; multi_io&gt; it appears I'm gathering a bunch of feature requests for Sun 
                  here
05:10 &lt; multi_io&gt; make for() able to use Iterators, make j.util.Collections's 
                  constructor protected
05:11 &lt; ojacobson&gt; I guarantee you both will be closed nearly immediately
05:11 &lt; ojacobson&gt; the former "duplicate" the latter "won't fix"
