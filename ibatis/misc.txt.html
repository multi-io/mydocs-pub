- is it possible to create &amp; execute select queries for which the SQL
  is supplied at runtime rather than in the mapping XML, while still
  retaining all the other features that queries can have (associated
  cache model, result map, etc.). In addition, is it possible to also
  determine the return type at runtime rather than in the XML?

  (this is needed in IseeR for implementing Collection&lt;ModelNode&gt;
  Repository#query(BooleanQuery), and maybe also for implementing some
  hypthetical new query methods like Collection&lt;ModelNode&gt;
  ModelNode#get(String generalizedPropName) where
  "generalizedPropName" may be either a simple property name or
  something like "studies.imageStacks.series")

  TODO: check out the $...$ (as opposed to #...#) syntax for
  specifying the SQL in XML. It appears that you can supply any part
  of the SQL there, not just single values. Unfortunately you have to
  do all the SQL quoting yourself because the supplied value must be a
  string (there's apparently no class for PreparedStatement-like
  "structured" query fragments)

  ("Dynamic Mapped Statements" are probably insufficient)

  - alternatively, get current connection (see below) and generate &amp;
    execute the SQL on that, but then still use iBATIS to map the
    ResultStream to objects?

- is it possible to write a query that doesn't do any JDBC operations,
  but still uses an iBATIS-supplied cache model?

  (this would be the easiest way to implement a transparent query
  cache on the client in IseeR)

- are cache models in iBATIS (the ones that you can specify for each
  select statement in the mapping XML) simple query caches? I guess it
  would be nice if they cached by primary key (which would imply that
  you'd have to tell iBATIS what that key is first ... is that
  possible?)

- does the $...$ expansion happen before or after the #propname# parsing?

- access the underlying java.sql.Connection of an SqlMapClient for the
  calling thread? #getCurrentConnection() probably?
