==========

Documentation, notes, code snippets etc. for various (generally IT-related or otherwise technical)
topics. Written over a rather long range of time, in varying stages of expertise, interest, mood,
and B.A.C. (just kidding).

Browseable (sort of) web version [here](http://multi-io.github.io/mydocs-pub/ "Project Page").
