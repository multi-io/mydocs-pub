before git commit, stuff (files etc.) must be "staged" for
committing. This is true for newly added files (must use "git add
somefile" to schedule somefile for inclusion in the next commit), but
also for files that were already part of the repository and were only
changed locally. This is a difference to cvs or svn, where e.g. "svn
commit" will automatically commit all locally made changes to files
that were already in the repository. "git commit" will not commit
anything unless it was manually staged previously. To stage a locally
modified file f for inclusion in the next commit, use "git add f"
again on the file even though it is in the repository
already. Alternatively (and probably preferably), you can use "git
commit -a" to automatically stage locally changed files and commit
them. So "git commit -a" seems to be essentially the closest
equivalent to "svn commit". (also, just like the latter, "git commit
-a" will *not* stage files that were only created locally and aren't
part of the repository yet).

To undo a "git add file", use "git rm --cached file" -- that will
"unstage" the file but not delete it in the filesystem, exactly
undoing the effect of the git add. (TODO: this only works if file is a
new file, not if it is a file that's already in the repository and was
only modified locally)

TODO: git add newsubdirectory apparently stages all new files in
newsubdirectory as well..?

03:58 &lt; loops&gt; multi_io, why do you want to "stage the directory" without any of the files staged?
03:59 &lt; multi_io&gt; I want to stage files in there, only manually.
04:00 &lt; multi_io&gt; looks like I can just cd thedirectory; git add file ...
04:00 &lt; loops&gt; multi_io, yes.
04:01 &lt; loops&gt; multi_io, you don't have to cd into the directory either... git add &lt;dir&gt;/{file1,file2,file3}   works as well



- git log -S'sometext'

  logs all commits whose diffs included sometext





04:24 &lt; multi_io&gt; is there an actual difference between a git "repository" and a "working copy" at all?
04:25 &lt; ToxicFrog&gt; it's possible to have a repository without a working copy (a "bare repo")
04:25 &lt; AAA_awright&gt; multi_io: The repository is the entire history, the working copy is the single revision checked out and (presumably) being edited 
                     (you mean that?)
04:26 &lt; multi_io&gt; AAA_awright: when I like "git clone /some/local/repository", it looks like I get the whole repository
04:26 &lt; ToxicFrog&gt; You do.
04:27 &lt; AAA_awright&gt; And without --bare it also checks out a working copy for you, in addition
04:27 &lt; multi_io&gt; so I can also just get a single checkout?
04:27 &lt; multi_io&gt; hm
04:27 &lt; AAA_awright&gt; multi_io: You can't as such, but you can download less by using --depth 1
04:28 &lt; AAA_awright&gt; That will download just the most recent files, then you can delete .git if you wish
04:28 &lt; AAA_awright&gt; idk how it works with a local filesystem repository...
04:30 &lt; multi_io&gt; ah, a "bare" repository is just the contents of .git ?
04:30 &lt; AAA_awright&gt; Yep
04:31 &lt; offby1&gt; aw reet
04:31 &lt; AAA_awright&gt; and with core.bare=true
04:32 &lt; multi_io&gt; ok
04:38 &lt; Ilari&gt; multi_io: Convention is to name bare repos 'foo.git'...


07:33 &lt; multi_io&gt; "git fetch teck:/home/olaf/test/git/test1" worked, apparently (printed stuff like "remote: Total 10 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)" 
                  etc.pp., whatever that means exactly :-P)
07:34 &lt; multi_io&gt; but now "git merge teck:/home/olaf/test/git/test1/master" only says "fatal: 'teck:/home/olaf/test/git/test1/master' does not point to a 
                  commit"
07:34 -!- patcito [n=pat@190.42.41.123] has quit [Remote closed the connection]
07:35 &lt; multi_io&gt; ah, FETCH_HEAD seems to be a valid name designating the fetched commit
07:37 &lt; Adlai&gt; multi_io: yes, git-fetch leaves FETCH_HEAD for merging
07:38 &lt; Adlai&gt; you could also do 'git remote update &lt;remote-name&gt;' if you have it configured as a remote, and then it will update tracking branches fro 
               you
07:38 &lt; Adlai&gt; *for




in a local repo, you can have alias names for remote repos. See also
"git help remote". If you initially clone a remote repo, that repo
will automatically be defined under the default alias name "origin" or
so. Issue "git remote -v" to see all defined remote aliases, "git
remote add name url" to add a new one, etc.

To pull changes from it, use "git pull &lt;remotename&gt; &lt;branch&gt;"
