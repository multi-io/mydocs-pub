revert local (uncommitted) changes:

git checkout HEAD -- path/to/file


git equivalent to hg rollback:

git reset --soft HEAD^


to unstage changes:

git reset HEAD &lt;files&gt;


to abort a merge:

git reset --hard


clone into existing non-empty directory "foo":

git clone --bare /some/where/foo.git
mv foo.git foo/.git
cd foo
git config core.bare false
git reset HEAD .



&lt;multi_io&gt; is it possible to directly fast-forward a non-checked out branch to the checked out branch?
[15:23] &lt;cehteh&gt; git push . brach:branch
[15:24] &lt;multi_io&gt; i.e. I've checked out branch B, and there's a branch A in the repo which is an ancestor of B, and I want to do the equivalent of git checkout A; git merge --ff-only B; git checkout B

=&gt; git push . B:A

&lt;cmn&gt; git branch -f A B would also work
&lt;cmn&gt; and be less magical



specifying commit ranges:

see git help rev-list

- git rev-list master: master and all commits reachable from it via "parent" relation

- git rev-list master ^other: master and all commits reachable from it, but not from other, via "parent" relation

from git help rev-list:

       You can think of this as a set operation. Commits given on the command line form a set of commits that are reachable
       from any of them, and then commits reachable from any of the ones given with ^ in front are subtracted from that set.
       The remaining commits are what comes out in the commandâ€™s output. Various other options and paths parameters can be used
       to further limit the result.

several commands take commit range arguments, e.g. cherry-pick.


directly moving HEAD pointer to any branch, without touching either
the index or the wd (essentially a checkout without modifying the
index or wd):

git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/&lt;branch&gt;

(after which you'd probably issue a "git reset" to copy the new HEAD
tree into the index)
