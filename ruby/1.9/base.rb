  end

  # This is the central interface module of the xml-mapping library.
  #
  # Including this module in your classes adds XML mapping
  # capabilities to them.
  #
  # == Example
  #
  # === Input document:
  #
  #   :include: company.xml
  #
  # === mapping class declaration:
  #
  #   :include: company.rb
  #
  # === usage:
  #
  #   :include: company_usage.intout
  #
  # So you have to include XML::Mapping into your class to turn it
  # into a "mapping class", that is, to add XML mapping capabilities
  # to it. An instance of the mapping classes is then bidirectionally
  # mapped to an XML node (i.e. an element), where the state (simple
  # attributes, sub-objects, arrays, hashes etc.) of that instance is
  # mapped to sub-nodes of that node. In addition to the class and
  # instance methods defined in XML::Mapping, your mapping class will
  # get class methods like 'text_node', 'array_node' and so on; I call
  # them "node factory methods". More precisely, there is one node
  # factory method for each registered <em>node type</em>. Node types
  # are classes derived from XML::Mapping::Node; they're registered
  # with the xml-mapping library via XML::Mapping.add_node_class.  The
  # node types TextNode, BooleanNode, NumericNode, ObjectNode,
  # ArrayNode, and HashNode are automatically registered by
  # xml/mapping.rb; you can easily write your own ones. The name of a
  # node factory method is inferred by 'underscoring' the name of the
  # corresponding node type; e.g. 'TextNode' becomes 'text_node'. Each
  # node factory method creates an instance of the corresponding node
  # type and adds it to the mapping class (not its instances). The
  # arguments to a node factory method are automatically turned into
  # arguments to the corresponding node type's initializer. So, in
  # order to learn more about the meaning of a node factory method's
  # parameters, you read the documentation of the corresponding node
  # type. All predefined node types expect as their first argument a
  # symbol that names an r/w attribute which will be added to the
  # mapping class. The mapping class is a normal Ruby class; you can
  # add constructors, methods and attributes to it, derive from it,
  # derive it from another class, include additional modules etc.
  #
  # Including XML::Mapping also adds all methods of
  # XML::Mapping::ClassMethods to your class (as class methods).
  #
  # It is recommended that if your class does not have required
  # +initialize+ method arguments. The XML loader attempts to create a
  # new object using the +new+ method. If this fails because the
  # initializer expects an argument, then the loader calls +allocate+
  # instead. +allocate+ bypasses the initializer.  If your class must
  # have initializer arguments, then you should verify that bypassing
  # the initializer is acceptable.
  #
  # As you may have noticed from the example, the node factory methods
  # generally use XPath expressions to specify locations in the mapped
  # XML document. To make this work, XML::Mapping relies on
  # XML::XXPath, which implements a subset of XPath, but also provides
  # write access, which is needed by the node types to support writing
  # data back to XML. Both XML::Mapping and XML::XXPath use REXML
  # (http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/) to represent XML
  # elements/documents in memory.

    ###### core node classes

    # Abstract base class for all node types. As mentioned in the
    # documentation for XML::Mapping, node types must be registered
    # using XML::Mapping.add_node_class, and a corresponding "node
    # factory method" (e.g. "text_node") will then be added as a class
    # method to your mapping classes. The node factory method is
    # called from the body of the mapping classes as demonstrated in
    # the examples. It creates an instance of its corresponding node
    # type (the list of parameters to the node factory method,
    # preceded by the owning mapping class, will be passed to the
    # constructor of the node type) and adds it to its owning mapping
    # class, so there is one node object per node definition per
    # mapping class. That node object will handle all XML
    # marshalling/unmarshalling for this node, for all instances of
    # the mapping class. For this purpose, the marshalling and
    # unmarshalling methods of a mapping class instance (fill_into_xml
    # and fill_from_xml, respectively) will call obj_to_xml
    # resp. xml_to_obj on all nodes of the mapping class, in the order
    # of their definition, passing the REXML element the data is to be
    # marshalled to/unmarshalled from as well as the object the data
    # is to be read from/filled into.
    #
    # Node types that map some XML data to a single attribute of their
    # mapping class (that should be most of them) shouldn't be
    # directly derived from this class, but rather from
    # SingleAttributeNode.

      # Intializer, to be called from descendant classes. _owner_ is
      # the mapping class this node is being defined in. It'll be
      # stored in _@owner_. @options will be set to a (possibly empty)
      # hash containing the option arguments passed to
