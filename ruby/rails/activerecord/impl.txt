ActiveRecord::Base:


important internal class methods:

- table_name()   # table name

  derived from the name of the class up the hierarchy from self
  onwards that descends from ActiveRecord directly. This table will
  hold all instances of that class as well as of all classes derived
  from it. In each row of the table, the SQL field "type" (if present)
  will hold the name of the ruby class of the instance saved in that
  row. If there is no "type" field, the class will be the one on which
  "instantiate" was called (see "instantiate" below)


- primary_key()  # name of PK field in #{table_name}

- connection / retrieve_connection()   # the low-level SQL connection

  The connection should be established using Base.establish_connection
  before any ActiveRecords are used. The call should basically look
  like this:

  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
         :adapter  => "mysql",
         :host     => "localhost",
         :username => "myuser",
         :password => "mypass",
         :database => "somedatabase"
       )

  See "establish_connection" and "retrieve_connection"  in
  lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter.rb for
  further information



- instantiate(record)   # create instance of self from record (hash of
                        # (field_name=>field_value) pairs).
                        # record should've been obtained by calling
                        # calling connection.select_..(sqlstring)
          object = record_with_type?(record) ? compute_type(record["type"]).allocate : allocate
          object.instance_variable_set("@attributes", record)
          return object

- primary_key   # name of PK field


important class methods:

- find(*ids)
  find_on_conditions(id, conditions)  # e.g. Person.find_on_conditions 5, "first_name LIKE '%dav%' AND last_name = 'heinemeier'"
  find_all(conditions = nil, orderings = nil, limit = nil, joins = nil)
  find_first(conditions = nil, orderings = nil)


- create(attributes = nil)

      # Creates an object, instantly saves it as a record (if the validation permits it), and returns it. If the save
      # fail under validations, the unsaved object is still returned.



important instance methods:

- save()   # save object to db

- ? attributes() / attributes=()    # new in ruby?

- ? instance_variable_set("@attributes", record)    # new in ruby

- read_attribute(name)

  read column <name> from self's row in db

- write_attribute(name, value)

  write <value> to column <name> in self's row in db


- method_missing(method_id, *arguments)

  delegates to write_attribute()/query_attribute()/read_attribute()
  depending on whether method_id ends with "=", "?", or nothing
  special, respectively. So, "p=Person.create(..); p.name = 'Hugo'"
  would end up calling p.write_attribute("name","Hugo")





addionally added functionality:
-------------------------------

ActiveRecord::Base.class_eval do
  include ActiveRecord::Validations
  include ActiveRecord::Callbacks
  include ActiveRecord::Associations
  include ActiveRecord::Aggregations
  include ActiveRecord::Transactions
  include ActiveRecord::Reflection
end


##### ActiveRecord::Associations (associations.rb)

    # TODO

##### ActiveRecord::Aggregations (aggregations.rb)

    #   class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     composed_of :address, :mapping => [ %w(address_street street), %w(address_city city) ]
    #   end

    # => the composed_of macro (class method) adds the following to
    # the "Customer" class:

    #        def address(force_reload = false)
    #          if @address.nil? || force_reload
    #            @address = Address.new(read_attribute("address_street"), read_attribute("address_city"))
    #          end
    #          return @address
    #        end
    #
    #        def address=(part)
    #          @address = part.freeze
    #          @attributes["address_street"] = part.street
    #          @attributes["address_city"] = part.city
    #        end

    => the aggregated object is stored in fields of its aggregating
       object's row.




instance methods of connection objects:

- select..()
  select_one(sql, "#{name} Find")
  select_all(sql, "#{name} Load")
  select_one(sql, "#{name} Load First")

  return records (arrays of hashes, each hash containing
                  field_name=>field_value mappings (field_names
                  redundantly in each hash))



- update(sql, "#{name} Update")

- ? columns(table_name, "#{name} Columns")

- apparently, the 2nd argument (name) is used for logging ouput only
